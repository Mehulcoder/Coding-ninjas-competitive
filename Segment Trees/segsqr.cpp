Segment trees are extremely useful. In particular "Lazy Propagation" (i.e. see here, for example) allows one to compute sums over a range in O(lg(n)), and update ranges in O(lg(n)) as well. In this problem you will compute something much harder:
The sum of squares over a range with range updates of 2 types:
1) increment in a range
2) set all numbers the same in a range.
Input
There will be T (T <= 25) test cases in the input file. First line of the input contains two positive integers, N (N <= 100,000) and Q (Q <= 100,000). 
The next line contains N integers, each at most 1000. Each of the next Q lines starts with a number, which indicates the type of operation:

2 st nd -- return the sum of the squares of the numbers with indices in [st, nd] {i.e., from st to nd inclusive} (1 <= st <= nd <= N).

1 st nd x -- add "x" to all numbers with indices in [st, nd] (1 <= st <= nd <= N, and -1,000 <= x <= 1,000).

0 st nd x -- set all numbers with indices in [st, nd] to "x" (1 <= st <= nd <= N, and -1,000 <= x <= 1,000).
Output
For each test case output the “Case <caseno>:” in the first line and from the second line output the sum of squares for each operation of type 2. Intermediate overflow will not occur with proper use of 64-bit signed integer.
Input:
2
4 5
1 2 3 4
2 1 4
0 3 4 1
2 1 4
1 3 4 1
2 1 4
1 1
1
2 1 1
Output:
Case 1:
30
7
13
Case 2:
1
